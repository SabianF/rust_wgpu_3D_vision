# rust_wgpu_3D_vision
A voxel renderer aimed at simulating stereoscopic 4D vision

# Updates

## From previous repo

1. Started following the incredibly difficult-to-understand Dr. Xu's guide up to video 3
1. Encountered errors ([eg1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18004993/how-to-determine-cause-of-directx-11-driver-hang), [eg2](https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic/703795-dxr-and-device-hung-error/))
1. I have no clue what the error (or help thread comments) mean, so I'm trying [a different tutorial](https://github.com/peerhenry/rust_hello_triangle)
1. I've reverted back to launching a functional empty window, and am now following the [official WGPU tutorial](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/beginner/tutorial1-window/#the-code)

## From this repo
1. Created resizeable window ([commit](https://github.com/SabianF/rust_wgpu_3D_vision/commit/094a5c9e4df79707d4df8df3e0bc1d2aa69d64f7))
1. todo: rendering 2D shape
